# Snaps, crackle and pop!
Snaps, a method of packaging and distributing software, have been a topic of heated debate in the Linux community. While some users appreciate the universal application platform that Snaps provide, many others have expressed their discontent.

## Proprietary Backend
One of the main reasons for the dislike towards Snaps is its proprietary backend. Unlike other packaging systems on Linux, such as Flatpaks, Snaps are controlled by a single company, Canonical. This means that only Canonical can create and host Snaps. This level of control over software sources in a Linux distribution is unprecedented and has been a point of contention among users.

## Forced Updates
Another major issue with Snaps is their update mechanism. Updates happen automatically in the background and cannot be turned off or reverted. This lack of control over updates has been likened to practices seen in other operating systems, which has not sat well with many in the Linux community.

## Performance Issues
Snaps have also been criticized for their performance. They are known to be slow to load, which can even slow down boot time. They also take up a lot of disk space, and some users have reported slower start times for apps when they use Snaps.

## Ignoring User Commands
There have been instances where Snaps have ignored direct commands to install a piece of software via apt. For example, when users try to install Firefox or Chromium via apt, it instead installs the browsers via Snap. This disregard for user commands has been seen as disrespectful by some users.

## Aesthetic Differences
Lastly, Snaps have been criticized for their appearance. They donâ€™t match the system theme, which can lead to an inconsistent and jarring user experience.
